The Highest Response Ratio Next algorithm (HRRN) is an algorithm whose priority for each job depends
on the estimated running time, and based on the amount of time spent waiting . Jobs get higher priority
the longer the work is postponed (starvation process). Even long jobs are delayed by CPUs competing
with jobs that are estimated to have a short period of time.

Pseudocode :
Initial ready_queue process, Arival_Time, Burst_Time, Ratio,
time_spent_waiting, Highest_Ration, Index_Highest_Ratio
While (ready_queue != null)
Execute task in Highest Response Ration Next manner
Check other task in ready queue
Do i to amount of task in ready_queue
Time_spent_waiting = Max interval time now â€“ Arival_time of task[i]
Ratio task[i] = (time_spent_waiting + burst_time of task[i]) / burst_time of task[i]
if(ratio task[i] > Highest_Ratio)
Highest_ratio = Ratio task[i]
Index_Highest_Ratio = i
End Do
Go to task[Index_Highest_Ratio]
End While
Compute Average waiting time
Compute Average Turn Around Time
