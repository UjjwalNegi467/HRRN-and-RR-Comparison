The Round Robin algorithm is a simple scheduling algorithm and is most used in time shared systems.
Each process is given a time interval called quantum time, as long as the process is in quantum time,
allowed to run . This algorithm selects the process from the front row and runs the process during the
given quantum time. The new process will be added to the back ready queue. 

PsuedoCode :
Initial ready_queue process, Arival_Time, Burst_Time,
Quantum_Time
while(ready_queue != null)
Execute task in Round Robin manner
If(Burst_time of task > Quantum_time)
If(other task on ready_queue during interval CPU time)
Put recent task after other task in ready_queue
else
Put recent task on ready_queue
else
go to other task in ready_queue
end while
computer Average waiting time
compute Average completion time
